Technical Skills:

I have managed to equip myslef with a number of technical skills:

Programming Languages: Here’s an example of what you can write here.

1. SQL – Used to query data in relational databases. For example, I used it to extract financial data and create reports on asset performance.

2. Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – It was used for data cleaning and preparation (pandas), numerical operations (NumPy), and trend charts (Matplotlib).
  
4. 1. Power BI – I leveraged it to create charts and interactive dashboards that showed asset classes, their geographical distribution, risk metrics, and returns.

2. Excel – This tool was useful in financial modeling and simulations of investment scenarios. For example, I extensively employed array formulas, data analysis, and statistical and logical functions.

3. Git – Used Git for version control, so all code and data analysis changes are tracked.

Projects Descriptions:

I will be giving each project a descprition inside the project files.
